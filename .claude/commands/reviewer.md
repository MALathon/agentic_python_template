## Common Issues and Fixes

### 1. Code Complexity
```python
# Bad: Complex nested conditions
def process_user(user):
    if user:
        if user.active:
            if user.email:
                if user.verified:
                    return process_verified_user(user)
                else:
                    return "User not verified"
            else:
                return "No email"
        else:
            return "User not active"
    else:
        return "No user"

# Good: Early returns and clear flow
def process_user(user):
    if not user:
        return "No user"
    
    if not user.active:
        return "User not active"
    
    if not user.email:
        return "No email"
    
    if not user.verified:
        return "User not verified"
    
    return process_verified_user(user)
```

### 2. Poor Error Handling
```python
# Bad: Generic exception handling
def fetch_data(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.json()
    except:
        return None

# Good: Specific error handling with logging
def fetch_data(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to fetch data from {url}: {str(e)}")
        raise DataFetchError(f"Could not fetch data from {url}") from e
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        logger.error(f"Invalid JSON response from {url}: {str(e)}")
        raise InvalidResponseError(f"Invalid JSON from {url}") from e
```

### 3. Missing Type Hints
```python
# Bad: No type hints
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)

# Good: Clear type hints
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """Calculate discounted price.
    
    Args:
        price: Original price
        discount_percent: Discount percentage (0-100)
        
    Returns:
        Discounted price
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent is not between 0 and 100
    """
    if not 0 <= discount_percent <= 100:
        raise ValueError(f"Discount percent must be between 0 and 100, got {discount_percent}")
    
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)
```

## Review Comments Best Practices

### Constructive Feedback
```
# Bad comment:
"This code is messy and hard to read."

# Good comment:
"Consider extracting this logic into a separate method called `validate_user_input()` 
to improve readability and reusability. This would also make it easier to test 
this validation logic in isolation."
```

### Providing Examples
```
# Bad comment:
"Use better variable names."

# Good comment:
"The variable name 'x' doesn't convey its purpose. Since it represents the user's 
age in years, consider renaming it to 'user_age_years' for clarity."
```
