### Coordination Agent

#### 13. Triage Agent
- **Role**: Task orchestration and intelligent routing
- **Launch**: `./scripts/launch-triage.sh`
- **Command**: `/triage`

## Dynamic Agent Orchestration

The template includes powerful orchestration capabilities for combining agents:

### Analyze Request
```bash
# Analyze any request to get agent recommendations
./scripts/orchestrate.sh analyze "build a user-friendly dashboard with real-time data"
```

### Pre-built Workflows

#### Standard Development Workflow
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh workflow "user authentication feature"
```

#### Product Development Workflow
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh product-workflow "new SaaS platform"
```

#### ML Project Workflow
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh ml-workflow "recommendation engine"
```

#### Deployment Workflow
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh deployment-workflow "my-app"
```

### Custom Agent Combinations

#### Parallel Execution
```bash
# Run multiple agents simultaneously
./scripts/orchestrate.sh parallel "ux:design mockups,developer:setup project,devops:prepare infrastructure"
```

#### Sequential Execution
```bash
# Run agents in order with dependencies
./scripts/orchestrate.sh sequence "architect:design system,developer:implement,tester:validate"
```

#### Custom Orchestration
```bash
# Define your own agent combination
./scripts/orchestrate.sh custom "customer:gather feedback,product:prioritize,ux:design,developer:implement,customer:validate"
```

### Example Orchestrations

**Full Product Launch:**
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh custom "product:define vision,research:market analysis,ux:user research,architect:system design,project:create plan,developer:build MVP,tester:validate,devops:deploy,customer:gather feedback"
```

**User Experience Improvement:**
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh custom "customer:collect feedback,ux:analyze issues,research:competitor analysis,ux:redesign,developer:implement changes,tester:usability testing,customer:validate improvements"
```

**Technology Migration:**
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh custom "research:evaluate options,portfolio:assess impact,architect:migration plan,project:timeline,developer:implement,tester:regression testing,devops:rollout strategy"
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup the Environment

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Setup the agents
./scripts/setup-agents.sh

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Using Agents

Start with the Task agent to break down your project:
```bash
claude code --task "Build a web scraping tool"
```

Then use specialized agents as needed:
```bash
# Design the architecture
./scripts/launch-architect.sh

# Implement features
./scripts/launch-developer.sh

# Write tests
./scripts/launch-tester.sh

# Review code
./scripts/launch-reviewer.sh
```

### 3. Project Rules

The `.claude/rules/project.md` file contains important project guidelines, including:
- Code style preferences
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Git commit conventions

## Customization

### Adding Project-Specific Configuration

1. Edit `pyproject.toml` to update project metadata
2. Modify `.claude/rules/project.md` to add your coding standards
3. Update agent commands in `.claude/commands/` for your workflow
4. Add project-specific dependencies to `requirements.txt`

### Creating Custom Agents

To create a new agent:

1. Create a command file in `.claude/commands/`
2. Define the agent's role and responsibilities
3. Create a launch script in `scripts/`
4. Document the agent in this README

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Task Agent**: Always begin by breaking down complex tasks
2. **Use Appropriate Agents**: Match agents to their specialized roles
3. **Maintain Context**: Keep `.claude/tasks/` updated with progress
4. **Follow Rules**: Adhere to guidelines in `.claude/rules/`
5. **Iterate**: Use Reviewer agent regularly for continuous improvement

## Project Layout

### Source Code (`src/`)
Place your Python packages and modules here. The template includes a basic structure that you can expand.

### Tests (`tests/`)
Mirror your source structure in the tests directory. Use pytest for testing.

### Documentation (`docs/`)
Keep your documentation organized and up-to-date. Consider using Sphinx for API documentation.
